## Installation

### Using the Install Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Install new website (removes OEM, installs replacement)
./cpc200_website.sh install 192.168.43.1

# Restore OEM website
./cpc200_website.sh restore 192.168.43.1
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# SSH to adapter
ssh root@192.168.43.1

# Extract to root filesystem
cd /mnt/UPAN
tar -xzf new_website.tar.gz -C /

# The Boa server will automatically use files from /etc/boa/
# on next reboot, or you can restart Boa manually
```

## API Endpoints

### OEM Endpoints (server.cgi)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `infos` | Get settings, device info, paired devices |
| `set` | Set configuration parameter |
| `reset` | Reset to previous config |
| `resetApp` | Factory reset (restore defaults) |
| `restart` | Reboot device |
| `BoxMonitor` | Real-time system stats |

### Custom Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/cgi-bin/config.cgi` | GET | Extended settings via riddleBoxCfg |
| `/cgi-bin/sysinfo.cgi` | GET | System stats (CPU, mem, temp, uptime) |
| `/cgi-bin/governor.cgi` | GET/POST | CPU governor control |
| `/cgi-bin/logs.cgi?type=X` | GET | Download logs (dmesg/userspace/config) |
| `/cgi-bin/wifi_clients.cgi` | GET | Connected WiFi clients |
| `/cgi-bin/restart.cgi` | POST | Restart device |

## Data Sources

The web interface queries settings from two sources:

1. **server.cgi `infos` command** - Returns 13 basic settings
2. **config.cgi** - Returns 11 extended settings via `riddleBoxCfg -g`

This dual-source approach is required because the OEM `infos` API doesn't return all settings.

## Notes

### Settings Marked with *
Settings marked with `*` in the UI may be overridden by the host app (CarPlay/Android Auto head unit) via USB protocol messages.

### Devices Tab
The Devices tab shows **saved/paired wireless devices** from `DevList`, not the currently active USB connection. This is the same behavior as the OEM website. The currently active connection (CarPlay/Android Auto) is shown on the Dashboard via `BoxMonitor.MDLinkType`.

### Known Firmware Bugs
- **CallQuality**: Setting has no effect due to firmware bug
- **AutoPlauMusic**: Firmware uses typo "Plau" instead of "Play"

### Security
- Input sanitization applied to text fields
- No external dependencies or CDN resources
- All code runs locally on the adapter

## Changelog

### v1.1 (2026-01-22)
- Factory reset now prompts for device restart after completion
- Added `doRestart()` helper for programmatic restart without confirmation
- Clarified Devices tab shows saved/paired devices only (same as OEM behavior)

### v1.0 (2026-01-20)
- Initial release
- Full settings parity with OEM
- Restored 10 hidden settings
- Added live system stats
- Added CPU governor control
- Added log downloads
